# Projects

=====Greyscaler=====
This repo contains my greyscale program, bitmaps.java - BinaryOutput.png and GreyOutput.png are the two output files associated with the program for the user to see sample output.  Also associated with the greyscale project are: cat.jpg, city.jpg, sunset.jpg, up.jpg, leaf.jpg, all of which are sample images for the user to test with.  However, any image can be used as long as it's in the same directory as bitmaps.java. The last two files greyValues.bmp and bitmap.bmp store the grey values and binary values respectively of the images.

=====Racing Game=====
A game where you can drive around a racetrack with a racecar.  Written in C++, it utilizes the SFML 2.3.2 library for graphics.  In order to be ran, the respective files must be put into a project and linked correctly. NOT FINISHED

=====Random Terrain=====
Generates random terrain and displays it to the user in a JFrame.  Currently, the RandomTerrain.java file generates terrain using the midpoint displacement algorithm, so the terrain is one-dimensional.
