# Projects

This repo contains my greyscale program, bitmaps.java - BinaryOutput.png and GreyOutput.png are the two output files associated with the program for the user to see sample output.  Also associated with the greyscale project are: cat.jpg, city.jpg, sunset.jpg, up.jpg, leaf.jpg, all of which are sample images for the user to test with.  However, any image can be used as long as it's in the same directory as bitmaps.java.  bitPolicy contains the file permissions to write to the two bitmaps.  bitmaps.html is only ever used for the appletviewer, and the last two files greyValues.bmp and bitmap.bmp store the grey values and binary values respectively of the images.
