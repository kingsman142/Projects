# Projects

=====Greyscaler=====
This repo contains my greyscale program, bitmaps.java - BinaryOutput.png and GreyOutput.png are the two output files associated with the program for the user to see sample output.  Also associated with the greyscale project are: cat.jpg, city.jpg, sunset.jpg, up.jpg, leaf.jpg, all of which are sample images for the user to test with.  However, any image can be used as long as it's in the same directory as bitmaps.java. The last two files greyValues.bmp and bitmap.bmp store the grey values and binary values respectively of the images.

=====Racing Game=====
A game where you can drive around a racetrack with a racecar.  Written in C++, it utilizes the SFML 2.3.2 library for graphics.  In order to be ran, the respective files must be put into a project and linked correctly. NOT FINISHED

=====Random Terrain=====
Generates random terrain and displays it to the user in a JFrame.  Currently, the RandomTerrain.java file generates terrain using the midpoint displacement algorithm, so the terrain is one-dimensional. Its corresponding examples can be seen through MidpointDisplacementExamples.png.  In DiamondSquare.java, terrain is generated using the diamond-square algorithm, so the terrain is outputted to a two-dimensional bitmap but can easily be translated to 3 dimensions.  Its corresponding examples are stored in DiamondSquareExamples.png, which each heightmap being 512x512.
