## Random Terrain Generator

This part of my Projects folder holds the main LWJGL (Java binding for OpenGL) source code for both the midpoint displacement, used for 2D terrain, and diamond-square, used for 3D terrain, algorithms.  In order to view the remaining LWJGL code, go up one directory and look at the LWJGL folder.  

The reason for moving some code here is to easily showcase my work through the videos and pictures of terrain.
