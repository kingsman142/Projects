0:00:00.000,0:00:02.552
>> You've gotten feedback[br]based on your responses and

0:00:02.552,0:00:04.720
we hope you take it seriously.

0:00:04.720,0:00:06.640
There are two options for what happened.

0:00:06.640,0:00:10.638
In option one, one or more of those[br]feedback messages said that now isn't

0:00:10.638,0:00:14.000
the right time for[br]you to begin this NIM degree.

0:00:14.000,0:00:17.485
Maybe you don't have some background[br]knowledge, but you can get it.

0:00:17.485,0:00:19.455
>> And once you get it,[br]you will be ready.

0:00:19.455,0:00:21.990
And remember, even once you[br]are ready to start the program,

0:00:21.990,0:00:24.700
there still will be[br]challenges along the way.

0:00:24.700,0:00:25.459
>> Exactly.

0:00:25.459,0:00:28.610
And option two is that you are ready.

0:00:28.610,0:00:31.308
And if you decide to make this[br]commitment, there's a good chance that

0:00:31.308,0:00:34.800
in a matter of months, your career[br]will be drastically different.

0:00:34.800,0:00:37.472
But even if you're ready and[br]you do make the commitment,

0:00:37.472,0:00:39.040
this will still be challenging.

0:00:39.040,0:00:39.840
>> Mm-hm.

0:00:39.840,0:00:43.280
It's perfectly possible that over the[br]next several months, you'll have times

0:00:43.280,0:00:46.671
where things feel challenging or you[br]feel frustrated, you feel overwhelmed or

0:00:46.671,0:00:49.900
maybe you even feel like you[br]don't belong in this program.

0:00:49.900,0:00:51.820
>> I wouldn't even say[br]perfectly possible.

0:00:51.820,0:00:54.880
I would say, very probable.

0:00:54.880,0:00:58.349
And those things are going to[br]happen when your code won't run and

0:00:58.349,0:00:59.549
you don't know why or

0:00:59.549,0:01:03.297
you feel lost in intimidating[br]jargon that you don't understand.

0:01:03.297,0:01:06.630
Or when you're trying to install[br]software and it won't run or

0:01:06.630,0:01:09.380
someone in the forum[br]is way ahead of you.

0:01:09.380,0:01:11.872
>> When these things happen, understand[br]that they happen to everybody.

0:01:11.872,0:01:12.506
>> Right.

0:01:12.506,0:01:16.510
And some of that struggle is[br]unavoidable and actually productive.

0:01:16.510,0:01:18.045
It's just what learning feels like.

0:01:18.045,0:01:18.612
>> Mm-hm.

0:01:18.612,0:01:20.443
And in those moments[br]when you're struggling,

0:01:20.443,0:01:23.419
it's important to remember too that you[br]have a whole community of your fellow

0:01:23.419,0:01:25.040
students out there to help you.

0:01:25.040,0:01:27.054
As well as your team of[br]Udacity coaches here.

0:01:27.054,0:01:27.822
>> And Google.

0:01:27.822,0:01:28.689
>> Yes, Google.

0:01:28.689,0:01:29.730
Amazing resource.

0:01:29.730,0:01:32.026
Definitely figure out how to[br]answer your own questions.

0:01:32.026,0:01:35.470
>> But not all of the struggle[br]with the productive kind.

0:01:35.470,0:01:37.264
Sometimes, it will be[br]because we made a mistake.

0:01:37.264,0:01:37.999
>> Mm-hm.

0:01:37.999,0:01:40.610
>> And we're constantly learning and[br]improving too.

0:01:40.610,0:01:42.358
So maybe our instructions[br]weren't clear or

0:01:42.358,0:01:44.305
maybe we assumed something[br]we shouldn't have.

0:01:44.305,0:01:44.941
>> Mm-hm.

0:01:44.941,0:01:46.870
When you're struggling,[br]be sure to let us know.

0:01:46.870,0:01:49.410
So like Andy said,[br]we can learn from your feedback.

0:01:49.410,0:01:52.010
Because that's,[br]that's how we learn how to improve.

0:01:52.010,0:01:52.820
>> Right.[br]The,

0:01:52.820,0:01:56.840
the bottom line is there will[br]be times when this is hard.

0:01:56.840,0:02:00.321
But if you persevere, you will succeed.

0:02:00.321,0:02:03.354
>> Whatever you choose to learn next and[br]however you choose to learn it,

0:02:03.354,0:02:05.552
remember that for[br]every obstacle you encounter,

0:02:05.552,0:02:08.080
you'll be able to do amazing[br]new things as a result of it.
