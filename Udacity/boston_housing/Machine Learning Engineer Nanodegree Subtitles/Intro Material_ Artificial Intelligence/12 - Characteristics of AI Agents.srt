In addition to AI problems having several characteristics,

0:00:04.220,0:00:09.740
AI agents too have several properties. Property number one. AI agents,

0:00:09.740,0:00:13.170
have only a limited computing power, processing speed, memory size, and

0:00:13.170,0:00:17.890
so on. Property number two. AI agents have limited sensors,

0:00:17.890,0:00:22.060
they cannot perceive everything in the world. Property number three.

0:00:22.060,0:00:26.220
AI agents have limited attention, they cannot focus on everything at the same

0:00:26.220,0:00:31.100
time. Property number four. Computational logic is fundamentally deductive.

0:00:32.600,0:00:37.090
Property number five. The world is large, but AI agents' knowledge of the world

0:00:37.090,0:00:42.150
is incomplete relative to the world. So, the question then becomes, how can AI

0:00:42.150,0:00:46.800
agents with such bounded rationality address open-ended problems in the world?
