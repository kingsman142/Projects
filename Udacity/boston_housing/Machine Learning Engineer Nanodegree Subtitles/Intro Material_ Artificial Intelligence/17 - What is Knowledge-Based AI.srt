Let us look at the processes that Watson may be using a little bit more closely.

0:00:05.250,0:00:09.250
Clearly Watson is doing a large number of things. It is trying to understand

0:00:09.250,0:00:12.650
natural language sentences. It is trying to generate some natural language

0:00:12.650,0:00:17.420
sentences. It is making some decisions. I'll group all of these things broadly

0:00:17.420,0:00:22.460
under reasoning. Reasoning is a fundamental process of knowledge based data.

0:00:22.460,0:00:25.417
A second fundamental process of knowledge based AIs learning.

0:00:26.460,0:00:31.500
What simply is learning also? It perhaps gets a right answer to some questions,

0:00:31.500,0:00:36.100
and stores that answer somewhere. If it gets a wrong answer, and then once it

0:00:36.100,0:00:40.060
learns about the right answer, it stores the right answer also somewhere.

0:00:40.060,0:00:43.400
Learning to is a fundamental process of knowledge based AI.

0:00:43.400,0:00:47.800
A third fundamental process of knowledge based ai is memory. If you're going to

0:00:47.800,0:00:52.220
learn something, that knowledge that you're learning has to be store somewhere,

0:00:52.220,0:00:56.780
in memory. If you're going to reason using knowledge, then that knowledge has to

0:00:56.780,0:01:01.250
accessed from somewhere, from memory. From memory process it will store,

0:01:01.250,0:01:04.640
what we learn as well as provide access to knowledge it will need for

0:01:04.640,0:01:08.920
reasoning. These three forms of processes of learning, memory, and

0:01:08.920,0:01:14.040
reasoning are intimately connected. We learn, so that we can reason.

0:01:14.040,0:01:18.480
The result of reasoning often. Result in additional learning.

0:01:18.480,0:01:23.200
Once we learn, we can store it in memory. However, we need knowledge to learn.

0:01:23.200,0:01:27.760
The more we know, the more we can learn. Reasoning requires knowledge that

0:01:27.760,0:01:33.470
memory can provide access to. The results of reasoning can also go into memory.

0:01:33.470,0:01:36.650
So, here are three processes that are closely related.

0:01:36.650,0:01:41.680
A key aspect of this course on knowledge based AI is that we will be

0:01:41.680,0:01:47.520
talking about theories of knowledge based AI that unify reasoning, learning,

0:01:47.520,0:01:53.610
and memory. And sort of, discussing any one of the three separately as sometimes

0:01:53.610,0:01:57.860
happens in some schools of AI. We're going to try to build, unify the concept.

0:01:59.130,0:02:05.570
These 3 processes put together, I will call them deliberation. This deliberation

0:02:05.570,0:02:12.080
process is 1 part of the overall architecture of a knowledge based AI agent.

0:02:12.080,0:02:15.339
This figure illustrates the older architecture of an AI agent.

0:02:16.530,0:02:21.310
Here we have input in the form of perceptions of the world. And

0:02:21.310,0:02:24.990
output in the form of actions in the world. The agent may have large number of

0:02:24.990,0:02:29.940
processes that map these perceptions to actions. We are going to focus right now

0:02:29.940,0:02:34.230
on deliberation, but the agent architecture also includes metacognition and

0:02:34.230,0:02:35.950
reaction, that we'll discuss later
