I hope our discussion of the big problems in AI didn't scare you off,

0:00:04.590,0:00:06.396
let's bring the discussion down, closer to work.

0:00:06.396,0:00:11.467
And talk about [UNKNOWN] fundamental characteristics of AI problems. Number one,

0:00:11.467,0:00:16.600
in many AI problems, data arrives incrementally not all the data comes

0:00:16.600,0:00:22.330
right at the beginning. Number two, problems often have a recurring pattern,

0:00:22.330,0:00:26.860
the same kinds of problems occur again and again. Number three,

0:00:26.860,0:00:31.500
problems occur at many different levels of abstraction. Problem number four,

0:00:31.500,0:00:35.720
many interesting AI problems are computationally intractable. Number five,

0:00:35.720,0:00:39.630
the world is dynamic, it's constantly changing but knowledge of

0:00:39.630,0:00:44.960
the world is relative to static. Number six, the world is open ended but

0:00:44.960,0:00:49.110
knowledge of the world is relatively limited. So, the question then becomes,

0:00:49.110,0:00:52.300
how can we design air agents that can address air problems with

0:00:52.300,0:00:56.060
these characteristics, those are the challenges we'll discuss in this course
