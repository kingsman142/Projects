Let's start a recognition today. We're discussing some of the biggest

0:00:03.490,0:00:07.140
problems in AI. We obviously are not going to solve all of them today, but

0:00:07.140,0:00:12.460
it's good to start with a big picture. AI has several conundrums,

0:00:12.460,0:00:17.070
I'm going to describe five of the main ones today. Conundrum number one.

0:00:17.070,0:00:21.020
All intelligent agents have little computational resources, processing speed,

0:00:21.020,0:00:25.370
memory size, and so on. But most interesting AI problems are computationally

0:00:25.370,0:00:30.150
intractable. How then can we get AI agents to give us near real time

0:00:30.150,0:00:35.650
performance on many interesting problems? Conundrum number two.

0:00:35.650,0:00:40.770
All competition is local, but most AI problems have global constraints. How then

0:00:40.770,0:00:45.650
can we get AI agents to address global problems using only local computation?

0:00:45.650,0:00:50.190
Conundrum number three. Computation logic is fundamentally deductive, but

0:00:50.190,0:00:53.880
many AI problems are abductive or inductive in their nature.

0:00:53.880,0:00:58.620
How can we get AI agents to address abductive or inductive problems? If you do

0:00:58.620,0:01:02.290
not understand some of these terms, like abduction, don't worry about it,

0:01:02.290,0:01:06.730
we'll discuss it later in the later in the class. Conundrum number four.

0:01:06.730,0:01:12.090
The world is dynamic, knowledge is limited, but an AI agent must always begin

0:01:12.090,0:01:16.320
with what it already knows. How then can an AI agent ever address a new problem?

0:01:18.040,0:01:21.490
Conundrum number five. Problem solving, reasoning, and learning

0:01:21.490,0:01:26.540
are complex enough, but explanation and justification add to the complexity.

0:01:26.540,0:01:30.780
How then can we get an AI agent to ever explain or justify it's decisions?
