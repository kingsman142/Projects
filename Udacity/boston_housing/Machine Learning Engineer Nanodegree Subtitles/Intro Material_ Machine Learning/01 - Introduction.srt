Hi, my name is Sebastian Thrun.

0:00:01.710,0:00:03.120
>> My name is Katie Malone.

0:00:03.120,0:00:05.770
>> And this is the machine learning class here at Udacity for

0:00:05.770,0:00:07.050
everybody to learn machine learning.

0:00:07.050,0:00:09.320
I am a research professor at Standford.

0:00:09.320,0:00:10.660
I am the founder of Udacity and

0:00:10.660,0:00:15.290
I also did things like Urban Self Learning Car, The DARPA Self Driving Car,

0:00:15.290,0:00:20.300
Challenge Ways, Google Street View, Google Glass, Google X.

0:00:20.300,0:00:23.760
And the secret behind my work is, all we do is to machine learning.

0:00:23.760,0:00:27.000
Machine learning is the core of what I do and machine learning enables me

0:00:27.000,0:00:29.390
to build amazing products and amazing user experiences.

0:00:29.390,0:00:32.720
>> I'm a physicist by training so I have a little bit of a different background.

0:00:32.720,0:00:34.721
But in physics we use machine learning all the time too.

0:00:34.721,0:00:37.852
And so what we do, is we start with gigantic data sets of lots of

0:00:37.852,0:00:40.400
particles that we create in our detector.

0:00:40.400,0:00:43.313
And we use machine learning to comb through those huge data sets and

0:00:43.313,0:00:44.571
to find the, the one event.

0:00:44.571,0:00:47.019
Or the, the ten events out of the millions and

0:00:47.019,0:00:49.480
billions that help us win Nobel prizes.

0:00:49.480,0:00:52.120
>> And doing good machine learning is just like making great wine.

0:00:52.120,0:00:53.800
So I have a bottle of wine here from Italy.

0:00:55.230,0:00:56.800
the, the, the analogy goes as follows.

0:00:56.800,0:01:00.170
If you want to, going to make a really great wine you have to make great grapes.

0:01:00.170,0:01:02.220
And if your grapes are no good, your wine is no good.

0:01:02.220,0:01:03.500
Same is true for machine learning.

0:01:03.500,0:01:04.000
You need good data.

0:01:04.000,0:01:06.540
You need to really understand your data really well.

0:01:06.540,0:01:08.980
And then there's a technique to it to make really great wine and

0:01:08.980,0:01:10.590
it's really hard to learn.

0:01:10.590,0:01:13.220
Same is true for machine learning there's a technique to look at data,

0:01:13.220,0:01:15.560
to understand data, to be able to apply algorithms.

0:01:15.560,0:01:17.500
And if you don't master the technique you

0:01:17.500,0:01:19.090
will never be a great machiner in person.

0:01:19.090,0:01:21.940
>> So in this class, in our machine learning class we're going to start with

0:01:21.940,0:01:23.940
a bunch of machine learning algorithms.

0:01:23.940,0:01:26.530
But we're also going to be looking at some really interesting datasets.

0:01:26.530,0:01:30.120
And we're going to be asking some really interesting and kind of hard questions.

0:01:30.120,0:01:32.690
But questions that we think are going to be really cool to answer.

0:01:32.690,0:01:35.340
So we're going to start from raw data, and then we're going to

0:01:35.340,0:01:38.398
show a machine learning process that sort of goes from beginning to end.

0:01:38.398,0:01:41.240
So that you can start with a dataset of your own.

0:01:41.240,0:01:43.080
And you know how to tackle it using machine learning.

0:01:43.080,0:01:44.740
We are here in Silicon Valley.

0:01:44.740,0:01:47.590
And in Silicon Valley machine learning is a big deal.

0:01:47.590,0:01:50.120
Companies like Netflix, Amazon, Google and

0:01:50.120,0:01:54.760
many others use data on a daily basis to optimize the product experience.

0:01:54.760,0:01:58.230
And I can tell you, if you're proficient in big data and understand data

0:01:58.230,0:02:02.480
science really well, you will find a job in Silicon Valley, very likely.

0:02:02.480,0:02:04.930
And the starting salaries are unbelievably high.

0:02:04.930,0:02:07.369
They are often north of $150 to an $1,000.

0:02:07.369,0:02:10.054
>> And even if you're not looking for a job in data science right now.

0:02:10.054,0:02:13.152
There's still probably lots of ways that machine learning is something that you

0:02:13.152,0:02:14.050
use everyday.

0:02:14.050,0:02:15.710
So when I go on Netflix at night.

0:02:15.710,0:02:17.650
How do I figure what, what movie I'm going to watch,

0:02:17.650,0:02:20.250
Netflix makes recommendation using machine learning.

0:02:20.250,0:02:22.900
When I use my credit card, to make a purchase.

0:02:22.900,0:02:25.680
There's fraud protection on it, that's machine learning as well.

0:02:25.680,0:02:28.830
You're get some insights into how all kinds of tools that you use

0:02:28.830,0:02:31.740
everyday are working, and they're built on top of machine learning.

0:02:31.740,0:02:32.930
>> This is a really great class.

0:02:32.930,0:02:33.540
>> It's learning by doing.

0:02:33.540,0:02:35.770
We'll see you in class.

0:02:35.770,0:02:36.790
>> We'll see you in class
