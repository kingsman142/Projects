So here we are in the heart of Silicon Valley at Google.

0:00:03.120,0:00:05.620
Machine learning is all over Silicon Valley.

0:00:05.620,0:00:09.140
>> Yeah, here at Google we're using machinery for, obviously for search, for

0:00:09.140,0:00:12.950
ranking the little pages that you going to see, for speech recognition, for

0:00:12.950,0:00:17.770
language translation and of course, for self driving cars.

0:00:17.770,0:00:20.880
>> One of my favorite examples is a little bit more trivial than that, but

0:00:20.880,0:00:22.394
I think it's really fun.

0:00:22.394,0:00:25.362
There is a company in Silicon valley that I actually tell it what clothes I

0:00:25.362,0:00:27.601
like, and then it'll figure out what my tastes are and

0:00:27.601,0:00:30.394
it'll sell me new clothes so I don't ever have to go shopping gain.

0:00:30.394,0:00:31.459
>> It is a machine learning algorithm?

0:00:31.459,0:00:33.350
>> It is a machine learning algorithm.

0:00:33.350,0:00:34.005
It is. >> So how did you have to train it?

0:00:34.005,0:00:36.067
>> It's really good, I didn't have to train it that long.

0:00:36.067,0:00:37.977
>> Wow. So is there a 10% bonuses?

0:00:37.977,0:00:39.574
>> I think, there probably, there should be, right?

0:00:39.574,0:00:40.794
>> [LAUGH] Here we go.

0:00:40.794,0:00:44.420
So Day, age of big data, yeah?

0:00:44.420,0:00:47.620
And, there is no company within a 10 mile radius that wouldn't use big data,

0:00:47.620,0:00:50.490
including Udacity, to optimize its products.

0:00:50.490,0:00:52.220
>> So, that's what we'll be learning about in this class,

0:00:52.220,0:00:54.360
there's all kinds of interesting examples here.

0:00:54.360,0:00:58.350
And, we'll go in great depth into a few questions in this class, but you should

0:00:58.350,0:01:01.060
always be thinking about interesting problems that you'd like to solve, and

0:01:01.060,0:01:02.550
how machine learning can help you out there.

0:01:02.550,0:01:04.500
>> And look, if you do a great job.

0:01:04.500,0:01:06.550
We do our best to find you a job here in Silicon Valley.
