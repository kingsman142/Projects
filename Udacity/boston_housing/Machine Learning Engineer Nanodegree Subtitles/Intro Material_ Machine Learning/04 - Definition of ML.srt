0:00:00.510,0:00:01.940
Hi Michael.[br]>> Hey Charles, how's it going?

0:00:01.940,0:00:03.460
>> It's going quite well,[br]how's it going with you?

0:00:03.460,0:00:04.110
>> Good.[br]Good.

0:00:04.110,0:00:05.138
>> Good Good.

0:00:05.138,0:00:08.761
So, today I thought we would talk[br]a little bit about the philosophy of

0:00:08.761,0:00:09.762
Machine Learning.

0:00:09.762,0:00:11.620
>> Oh, I hate philosophy.

0:00:11.620,0:00:14.406
>> I don't like it much either,[br]although I am a doctor of philosophy.

0:00:14.406,0:00:15.451
>> Oh, that's very impressive.

0:00:15.451,0:00:16.910
>> Aren't you a doctor[br]of philosophy too?

0:00:16.910,0:00:17.809
>> I am, it's kind of impressive.

0:00:17.809,0:00:19.145
>> It is kind of impressive.

0:00:19.145,0:00:22.245
So what we wanted to kind of get across[br]today was a little bit about why we,

0:00:22.245,0:00:24.300
the class is structured the way it is.

0:00:24.300,0:00:25.070
What the different parts are.

0:00:25.070,0:00:26.830
And maybe go a little bit of back and

0:00:26.830,0:00:30.189
forth about what we think you should[br]be getting out of the course.

0:00:30.189,0:00:30.886
That seem reasonable?

0:00:30.886,0:00:31.490
>> Sure.

0:00:31.490,0:00:32.276
>> Okay.[br]Well, so,

0:00:32.276,0:00:35.257
first off, by the way, before we get[br]started, I wanted to thank you for

0:00:35.257,0:00:38.458
coming down to Atlanta, and[br]joining me in these beautiful, studios.

0:00:38.458,0:00:40.010
>> Well, it's, it's,[br]it's very nice to be here.

0:00:40.010,0:00:41.490
Thank you for inviting me.

0:00:41.490,0:00:42.770
>> Oh, no, no, thank you for[br]coming, Michael.

0:00:42.770,0:00:44.420
>> Thank you for[br]asking me to do the course.

0:00:44.420,0:00:45.860
This has been a lot of fun.

0:00:45.860,0:00:47.460
>> Oh, the whole point was to be able[br]to do the course with you, Michael.

0:00:48.640,0:00:51.033
We like each other, and that's one of[br]the things that we want you to get,

0:00:51.033,0:00:53.322
want to get across in this class,[br]because we like machine learning.

0:00:53.322,0:00:57.485
We've a lot of stuff in common, but I'm[br]not sure we completely agree on the most

0:00:57.485,0:01:01.232
important parts of machine learning and[br]why we do the things that we do.

0:01:01.232,0:01:02.235
>> Hm, all right.

0:01:02.235,0:01:04.054
>> So[br]I think people in the outside world,

0:01:04.054,0:01:07.042
Michael, would claim that you're[br]more theoretical than I am.

0:01:07.042,0:01:07.727
>> In theory.

0:01:07.727,0:01:10.639
>> In theory, and[br]I'm more practical than you are.

0:01:10.639,0:01:11.593
>> Practically.

0:01:11.593,0:01:13.140
>> At least in practice.

0:01:13.140,0:01:16.046
And hopefully some of that tension[br]will come out in the class.

0:01:16.046,0:01:18.941
But I think in order to see why[br]that tension works that way,

0:01:18.941,0:01:21.250
you have to understand[br]what machine learning is.

0:01:21.250,0:01:21.790
So, Michael.

0:01:21.790,0:01:22.730
>> Right.

0:01:22.730,0:01:23.600
>> What's machine learning?

0:01:23.600,0:01:25.530
>> It's about proving theorems.

0:01:25.530,0:01:26.624
>> [LAUGH] No.

0:01:26.624,0:01:28.469
>> No.[br]>> I would not say it's about proving

0:01:28.469,0:01:32.007
theorems, although proving theorems is[br]often important in machine learning.

0:01:32.007,0:01:32.888
>> I agree with that.

0:01:32.888,0:01:34.224
>> Okay.[br]>> So we're on the same page.

0:01:34.224,0:01:35.501
>> We're partially on the same page.

0:01:35.501,0:01:37.299
What is machine learning?

0:01:37.299,0:01:38.450
>> What is machine learning?

0:01:38.450,0:01:39.200
>> Give me a definition.

0:01:39.200,0:01:43.969
>> So it is computational statistics.

0:01:43.969,0:01:45.409
How's that for a definition?

0:01:45.409,0:01:46.251
>> That is a definition.

0:01:46.251,0:01:47.892
It is wrong on so many levels.

0:01:47.892,0:01:50.201
However, a lot of people would[br]agree with that statement.

0:01:50.201,0:01:53.877
They would say that machine learning[br]is really just applied statistics.

0:01:53.877,0:01:54.831
>> Not applied statistics.

0:01:54.831,0:01:56.548
Computational statistics.

0:01:56.548,0:01:59.563
>> Computationally applied statistics.

0:01:59.563,0:02:01.284
I don't like that definition.

0:02:01.284,0:02:03.798
I think that it's a bit too narrow.

0:02:03.798,0:02:07.034
I think that machine learning[br]is about this broader notion of

0:02:07.034,0:02:10.687
building artifacts,[br]computational artifacts, typically.

0:02:10.687,0:02:12.820
That learn over time[br]based on experience.

0:02:12.820,0:02:15.610
And then in particular,[br]it's not just the act

0:02:15.610,0:02:19.101
of building these artifacts that matter,[br]it's the math behind it.

0:02:19.101,0:02:20.684
It's the science behind it.

0:02:20.684,0:02:22.663
It's the engineering behind it,[br]and it's the computing behind it.

0:02:22.663,0:02:27.324
It's everything that goes into building[br]intelligent artifacts that almost by

0:02:27.324,0:02:29.419
necessity have to learn over time.

0:02:29.419,0:02:30.730
You buy that?

0:02:30.730,0:02:33.750
>> Yeah, so you, you have data, and[br]you do analysis of the data and

0:02:33.750,0:02:34.968
try to glean things from the data.

0:02:34.968,0:02:40.850
And you used, various kinds of[br]computational structure to do that,

0:02:40.850,0:02:42.710
so, computational statistics.

0:02:42.710,0:02:45.330
>> I don't think that's[br]computational statistics.
