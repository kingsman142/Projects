0:00:00.110,0:00:04.530
This class is divided into[br]three subclasses, three parts.

0:00:04.530,0:00:06.010
They are supervised learning.

0:00:06.010,0:00:07.670
>> Yeah.[br]>> Unsupervised learning,

0:00:07.670,0:00:08.470
and reinforcement.

0:00:09.540,0:00:12.145
So, what do you think[br]supervised learning is?

0:00:12.145,0:00:17.510
>> So, I think of supervised learning[br]as being the problem of taking labelled

0:00:17.510,0:00:23.057
data sets, gleaning information from[br]it so that you can label new data sets.

0:00:23.057,0:00:24.138
>> That's fair.

0:00:24.138,0:00:26.355
I call that function approximation.

0:00:26.355,0:00:28.798
So, here's an example[br]of supervised learning.

0:00:28.798,0:00:31.342
I'm going to give you an input and[br]an output.

0:00:31.342,0:00:32.912
And I'm going to give[br]them to you as pairs, and

0:00:32.912,0:00:34.360
I want you to guess[br]what the function is.

0:00:34.360,0:00:35.441
>> Sure.[br]>> Okay?

0:00:35.441,0:00:36.185
Okay.

0:00:36.185,0:00:36.845
1, 1.

0:00:36.845,0:00:37.925
>> Uh-huh.

0:00:37.925,0:00:38.784
2, 4.

0:00:38.784,0:00:40.920
>> Wait, hang on,[br]is 1 the input and 1 the output,.

0:00:40.920,0:00:42.840
>> Yes.[br]>> And 2 the input, and 4 the output?

0:00:42.840,0:00:44.057
>> Correct.[br]>> All right.

0:00:44.057,0:00:45.820
I'm on, I think I am on to you.

0:00:45.820,0:00:46.440
>> 3, 9.

0:00:46.440,0:00:47.628
>> Okay.[br]>> 4, 16.

0:00:47.628,0:00:48.383
>> Nice.

0:00:48.383,0:00:49.148
>> 5, 25.

0:00:49.148,0:00:50.426
6, 36.

0:00:50.426,0:00:51.446
7, 49.

0:00:51.446,0:00:52.666
>> Nice.

0:00:52.666,0:00:53.503
This is a very hip data set.

0:00:53.503,0:00:54.349
>> It is.

0:00:54.349,0:00:56.010
What's the function?[br]>> It's hip to be squared.

0:00:56.010,0:00:57.200
>> Exactly.

0:00:57.200,0:00:58.490
Maybe.

0:00:58.490,0:00:59.660
So if you believe that's true,

0:00:59.660,0:01:02.150
then tell me if the input is 10,[br]what's the output?

0:01:02.150,0:01:04.519
>> 100.[br]>> And that's right, if it turns out,

0:01:04.519,0:01:06.880
in fact, that the function is x squared.

0:01:06.880,0:01:09.920
But the truth is, we have no idea[br]whether this function is x squared.

0:01:09.920,0:01:11.800
Not really.[br]>> I have a pretty good idea.

0:01:11.800,0:01:12.360
>> You do?[br]>> Well-

0:01:12.360,0:01:13.760
>> Where's that idea come from?

0:01:13.760,0:01:17.070
>> It comes from having spoken with[br]you over a long period of time.

0:01:18.520,0:01:19.990
And plus, you know, math.

0:01:19.990,0:01:20.970
>> And plus math.

0:01:20.970,0:01:22.430
Well, I'm going to-

0:01:22.430,0:01:23.100
>> You can't say I'm wrong.

0:01:23.100,0:01:24.230
>> You're wrong.

0:01:24.230,0:01:25.060
>> Oh.[br]>> Yeah, I did.

0:01:25.060,0:01:25.910
>> You just said I was wrong.

0:01:25.910,0:01:28.330
>> No, you've talked to me for[br]a long time, and plus math.

0:01:28.330,0:01:29.280
I agree with that.

0:01:29.280,0:01:30.280
>> Okay.[br]>> But

0:01:30.280,0:01:32.510
I'm going to claim that you're[br]making a leap of faith.

0:01:32.510,0:01:34.110
>> Hm.[br]>> Despite being a scientist,

0:01:34.110,0:01:37.019
by deciding that the input is 10 and[br]the output is 100.

0:01:38.120,0:01:39.250
>> Sure.[br]I would agree with that.

0:01:39.250,0:01:40.562
>> What's that leap of faith?

0:01:40.562,0:01:44.903
>> Well, I mean, from what you told me,[br]it's still consistent with lots of

0:01:44.903,0:01:48.840
other mappings from input to[br]output like 10 gets mapped to 11.

0:01:48.840,0:01:51.046
>> Right or[br]everything is x squared except 10.

0:01:51.046,0:01:51.603
>> Sure.

0:01:51.603,0:01:53.344
>> Or everything is x,[br]x squared up to 10.

0:01:53.344,0:01:54.365
>> Right, that would be mean-

0:01:54.365,0:01:55.446
>> That would be mean-

0:01:55.446,0:01:57.802
>> But it's not logically impossible.

0:01:57.802,0:01:59.161
>> What would be the median?

0:01:59.161,0:02:00.100
>> A-ha.

0:02:00.100,0:02:00.727
>> Thank you very much.

0:02:00.727,0:02:01.955
I, I was saving that one up.
