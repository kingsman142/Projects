    "**Answer: ** <p>\n",
    "***Decision Trees*** - Decision trees are commonly used \"in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal, but are also a popular tool in machine learning\"[1]. They are used for classification and regression by learning about simple decisions among the data along the way, forming a sort of tree.  Because of this, one of its strengths is its efficiency; if the data is split by a given decision node 50/50 for all nodes, then the decision tree has O(lgN) run-time.  Another strength is that decision trees are \"able to handle both numerical and categorical data.\"[5] Other strengths are that they are easy to understand and implement while also requiring very little data to form the tree.  However, major weaknesses are that the data can be easily overfit, which is bad; this is caused by over-complex trees (too many decision nodes).  Also, the tree may be balanced if a lot of the data falls under 1 or 2 leaf, or output, nodes; obviously, you do not want an unbalanced decision tree because then learning is harder.  Lastly, a decision tree may be unstable due to very small fluctuations in the data; for example, in the first decision node of the tree (the root node), if just that first decision is very slightly off, the class of the output data is automatically on the complete opposite side of the tree and it may not even belong there.  I chose this method because of its runtime efficiency, the output is easier to understand than a support vector machine, and decision trees handle both numerical and categorical data, which is perfect because our dataset contains both.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Gaussian Naive Bayes*** - \"Naive Bayes has been studied extensively since the 1950s. It was introduced under a different name into the text retrieval community in the early 1960s, and remains a popular (baseline) method for text categorization, the problem of judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as the features.\"[2] This model maps two variables on a scatterplot with the Gaussian Naive Bayes model, a line of best fit will split positive (good, or in this case, non-dropout) cases from the negative cases with the least amount of error (just like the example given in the course with road bumpiness and slope determining if a car should drive fast or slow).  A major strength of naive bayes is that it is a very efficient algorithm and it can be easily implemented. Another strength is that you only need \"a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary parameters.\"[4]  However, a weakness is that the data is assumed to be a Gaussian distribution; so, if the data is not Gaussian, there may be incorrect calculations when calculating the conditional probability.  I chose this model to be applied because, as mentioned before, it is a very fast algorithm and we don't have much training data so GaussianNB should work effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Support Vector Machines*** - SVMs are \"often used in industrial applications either when data is not labeled or when only some data is labeled as a preprocessing for a classification pass\"[3]. When utilizing SVMs, it can be applied any problem that needs classification OR regression.  Some benefits of SVMs are that it can be used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.  In addition, when classifying data, not only can it be linearly separable with a line, but it can also be separable with any curve.  And to add onto that, SVMs work very well and efficiently when the data has clear domains and can be easily separated.  However, because it can be separable with any nth degree polynomial (sometimes a high degree polynomial might be a good choice, and sometimes it can be very very bad), that means it is open to overfitting, which is a huge problem (this is similar to changing the C parameter of an SVM in sklearn).  Some other disadvantages are that they don't work well with large amounts of data since the SVM would have to calculate the marginalization between too many points,compared to smaller data sets (this would result in a performance hit) nor do they work well when the data has a ton of noise, as that messes with its margin calculations.  Given this data, I chose this model because I don't believe there is too much data that needs to be messed with (so we don't have to worry about that disadvantage) and so we should be able to easily classify students into whether or not they will be dropouts or not.\n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

As you can see from my presentation of data, the SVM may have taken a bit more time than the Naive Bayes and Decision Tree models, but the Decision Tree may easily be vulnerable to overfitting, so I avoided that.  As for Naive Bayes, SVM has it beat in the F1 score for not only the training dataset, but also the testing dataset, which is obviously very important when analyzing data; we need the accuracy of our results to be very high, and I believe the performance hit is still worth it."

First off, the data is \"trained\" by choosing the two closest points between two different classes; in our situation, we have Class A that is a dropout and Class B that is not a dropout.  When it finds those two closest points, the SVM will find a line that is perfectly in between those two points and tries to split the two classes in the most clear boundary as possible.  By \"most clear\" I mean the line has the biggest margin of space in between the two classes and it tries as hard as possible to not touch any data points of either class.  This line is typically called the hyperplane (refer to image below).\n",

This SVM will make a prediction by plotting that student on the graph and assessing whether the student is above or below the line.  If the student is above the line, which is where all of the Class A students are at, then the incoming student will be classified as Class A.  However, if the student is below the line, which is where the Class B students are at, he/she will be classified as a danger and is in need of an intervention."
